# flask_stackoverflow_clone
Out of boredom I created a stack overflow clone using python flask. Done it to simply test and improve my skills. It might not work since I didn't include the venv file. I am an intermidiate developer and this was one of my first projects that I made.

I added features like registration and login, submitting a question and then being able to edit it or deleteing it.

A user is also able to submit an answer. Other users can also upvote or downvote answers or questions. The user which submitted the answer can also delete it or edit it.

Also added a 'profile' feature where a User can receive points by answering question or answers and getting upvoted by those answers. Those points can then be used to buy 'ranks'. User also gets levels or xp on successfully answering questions or submitting questions.
